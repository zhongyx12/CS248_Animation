CS248 Final Project

Name: Yangxin Zhong, Zhi Bie

SuNet ID: yangxin, zhib

Project title: Animation: forward and inverse kinematics

Deliverable: 
	1. We have implemented 4 tools for animation: spline interpolation, forward and inverse kinematics, linear blend skinning, and physical simulation.

	2. We drew an animation of a dancing man with our tools. You can place 'Cardinal3D_buffer2.dae' and 'Cardinal3D_buffer2_0_skel.xml' files into Cardinal3D\build\src folder, run the program, and press w 2 to load the animation. We also provide a screen record of the dancing man video in 'dancing.mp4'.

Comment:
	We built this animation by first loading the human mesh, then draw skeleton to control the mesh. The control radius of each joint is adjusted for the best effect.
