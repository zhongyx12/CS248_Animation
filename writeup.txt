Comments and considerations: 
	1. I spent a lot of time on edge cases, but might still have error in extreme edge cases;
	2. When editing mesh with boundary, sometimes it fails to render some edges or faces, but
	   those edges or faces are still there. If you click on them, you can still select them.
	   There might exist some issues in the rendering part of the skeleton code, since the
	   build from TA also have similar problems.
