CS248 Final Project

Project title: Animation: forward and inverse kinematics

Summary: 
	We extended the Assignment 2 codebase and implemented 4 tools for animation: spline interpolation, forward and inverse kinematics, linear blend skinning, and physical simulation.

Approach:
	We followed the guidebook on Wiki and also lecture slides to implement these tools. Staff should know these materials very well, so we won't dive into details of the approach here. 

Results:
	We drew an animation of a dancing man with our tools. You can place 'Cardinal3D_buffer2.dae' and 'Cardinal3D_buffer2_0_skel.xml' files into Cardinal3D\build\src folder, run the program, and press w 2 to load the animation. We also provide a screen record of the dancing man video in 'dancing.mp4'.

Comment:
	We built this animation by first loading the human mesh, then draw skeleton to control the mesh. The control radius of each joint is adjusted for the best effect.
